It is recommended to use a mod manager to install PlanBuildLocations and all of its dependencies.

If you want to install it manually, load all of these mods as they are all required for PlanBuildLocations to function and install them according to their respective install instructions:

* [BepInExPack for Valheim](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim)
* [Jötunn, the Valheim Library](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/Jotunn)

Finally extract *all* of the contents of the PlanBuildLocations mod archive into ```<Valheim>\BepInEx\plugins\PlanBuildLocations```
